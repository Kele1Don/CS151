/*The game chosen is the Wheel of Fortune which allows three (3) players, the most, to compete in puzzle-solving trivia determined by spinning a carnival wheel.
The game is based on the television show created by Merv Griffin in 1975 which was derived from the game of Hangman.
Every round of the game starts off with blank spaces and/or punctuation marks to represent a word or phrase.
The Wheel consists of prizes which would be considered as the Fortune but also features the misfortune of going “Bankrupt” and “Losing a turn”.
Each player gets a chance to spin the wheel to determine a prize value and to guess a consonant while trying to avoid the misfortunes.
There are four (4) rounds in total to determine a winner if there isn’t a tie. 
In the first three (3) rounds, the wheel contains a Wild Card. 
The Wild Card may be used to call an additional consonant after any turn or taken to the bonus round to call an extra consonant there.
Each round features five toss-up puzzles, which reveal the puzzle one random letter at a time, and awards to whoever answers with the right answer. 
If a tie for first place occurs after the third round, an additional toss-up puzzle is played between the players who are tied for the win. 
The player who wins then advances to the bonus round.*/
